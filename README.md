Fresh Laravel Installation with integrated Instagram Authentication

The Socialite package doesn't support authentication via Instagram. This package https://packagist.org/packages/ramsey/laravel-oauth2-instagram provides instagram authentication and authorization out of box. I've implemented this package on a fresh Laravel 5.7 installation and added basic routes and views to enable you to check the flow. 

How to install?

Step 1: Clone this repository

Step 2: Add your instagram credentials to .env file
You can refer .env.example file for the variables used for storing the client id, client secret and redirect url

Step 3: Run composer update
Composer will include required packages

Step 4: Configure your server to host this project/website

Step 5: Done!
You have a running application with Instagram Authentication pre-configured for you.
